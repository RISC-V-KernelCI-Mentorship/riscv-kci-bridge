# Project dependencies

Services run in `Docker` containers, so most dependencies will be covered in the images.
However, tu run the project locally you'll at least need:

* `Python >= 3.12`
* `docker`
* `docker compose`
* `make`
* `poetry >= 2.1.2`
* `curl`
* `libpq-dev`
* `gcc`
* `autoconf`
* `automake`
* `build-essential`
* `libtool`
* `git`
* `libc-dev`
